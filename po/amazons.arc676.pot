"Amazons is a game invented in 1988 by Walter Zamkauskas of Argentina. It's "
"similar to go and chess. Two players each control a number of Amazons. These "
"can move any number of squares in any direction like chess queens. After "
"moving, they shoot an arrow which permanently occupies the tile on which it "
"lands. The arrow can land on any square accessible by a chess-queen-like "
"move from the Amazon's new location. Amazons and arrows cannot move across a "
"square if it is occupied by an arrow or another Amazon. The first player "
"unable to make a legal move loses. Equivalently, the last player able to "
"make a legal move wins the game."

"The Game of the Amazons can be played with any number of Amazons and on any "
"board size or shape. You can configure the game parameters in the game "
"settings. The standard configuration involves 4 Amazons for each player on a "
"10x10 grid. If the entirety of the board does not fit on screen, you can "
"drag to view different areas of the board. The player represented by the "
"bows always plays first. At the bottom of the screen, the current player is "
"indicated. To make a move, tap an Amazon you control, a valid destination "
"square, and a square to which to shoot. Tapping an invalid square at any "
"point will not affect the app state."

"Tap the clockwise-facing reset button to start a new game using the standard "
"configuration. This is also the configuration used when the app is launched. "
"Tap the counterclockwise-facing reset button to start a new game with a "
"custom starting configuration. The parameters are set in the game settings. "
"During a game, tap the undo button to clear your square selections and start "
"over. It is not currently possible to undo a completed move. While setting "
"up a custom game, tap the undo button to undo the last selection."
