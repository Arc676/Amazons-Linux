"Amazons is a game invented in 1988 by Walter Zamkauskas of Argentina. It's "
"similar to go and chess. Two players each control a number of Amazons. These "
"can move any number of squares in any direction like chess queens. After "
"moving, they shoot an arrow which permanently occupies the tile on which it "
"lands. The arrow can land on any square accessible by a chess-queen-like "
"move from the Amazon's new location. Amazons and arrows cannot move across a "
"square if it is occupied by an arrow or another Amazon. The first player "
"unable to make a legal move loses. Equivalently, the last player able to "
"make a legal move wins the game."

"The Game of the Amazons can be played with any number of Amazons and on any "
"board size or shape. You can configure the game parameters in the game "
"settings. The standard configuration involves 4 Amazons for each player on a "
"10x10 grid. This configuration is also available for gameplay. If the "
"entirety of the board does not fit on screen, you can drag to view different "
"areas of the board. The player represented by the bows always plays first. "
"At the bottom of the screen, the current player is indicated. To make a "
"move, tap an Amazon you control, a valid destination square, and a square to "
"which to shoot. Tap the undo button to clear your square selections and "
"start over. Tapping an invalid square at any point will not affect the app "
"state. It is not currently possible to undo a completed move."
